Here are 20 interview questions covering Data Types, Operators, Conditional Statements, Looping Statements, and Functions:

**Data Types:**
1. What is the difference between a primitive data type and a reference data type in programming?
2. Explain the concept of type casting and provide an example.
3. What is the significance of variable scope in relation to data types?
4. Differentiate between integers and floating-point data types. Provide examples.
5. How do you declare and use character data types in different programming languages?

**Operators:**
6. What is the difference between the '==' operator and the '===' operator in JavaScript?
7. Explain the concept of short-circuit evaluation with logical operators in programming.
8. How does the 'ternary' or 'conditional' operator work, and when is it commonly used?
9. Discuss the bitwise operators and provide an example of their use.
10. What is operator overloading, and why is it important in some programming languages?

**Conditional Statements:**
11. What is the difference between 'if', 'else if', and 'else' statements, and when would you use each in a program?
12. Explain the use of a 'switch' statement and provide an example.
13. What is the purpose of a 'conditional ternary operator' and how does it differ from 'if-else' statements?

18. Explain the concept of an 'infinite loop' and provide examples.
19. How do you prevent an infinite loop, and what debugging techniques can be used to identify one?
20. Discuss the 'for-each' loop or 'for...of' loop, and how it's used in various programming languages.

**Functions:**
21. Define a function and explain its role in programming.
22. What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression?
23. How do you pass arguments to a function, and what are the types of parameters?
24. Discuss the concept of 'recursion' in functions and provide an example.
